## Spotify Full Album Finder

Find and spot every release of you're chosen artist in spotify.

#### Features

- Showing the repetitive tracks in a strikethrough yellow and other first-appeared tracks in green
- In the first, albums analyzed, then singles/EPs/etc, then 'appears-on's. So if the song is in a album, it shows it in green only for the album.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

You need to install python 3 and add it to your systems path.
My python version: 3.11.2

#### Installation

1. Open terminal in the root directory and install requirement with this command:
   `python install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make a `config.py` file in the root directory, and put this text inside it:
   ```
   SPOT_CLIENT_ID = 'Your Client ID'
   SPOT_CLIENT_SECRET = 'Your Client Secret'
   ```
   to find your client ID and secret, make an app in [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and find them in the settings of the app.

#### Usage

Once you're in the root directory, simply run the app using `python full_album.py`.
